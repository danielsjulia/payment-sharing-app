Good job, some minor issues -

- Some cleanup needed, there is commented out code. On the AppController I don't think userIdentity() is needed.

- When sending money to someone, you should exclude yourself from the list.

- The functionality to check whether or not there is enough balance to make a transfer should be on the server
side. Ideally, you send in the request regardless and the server will check the balance and throw an exception
if there is insufficient money. The client can then handle the exception.
